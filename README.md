## Heart Disease Mortality Web App
This project is a web application built using R Shiny to visualize heart (cardiovascular) disease mortality data among US adults aged 35 and above. The data spans the years 2016 to 2018, representing a 3-year average. The primary goal of this app is to provide an interactive and user-friendly way to explore and understand heart disease mortality rates across different states in the United States.

Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Chronic Data webpage of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The specific dataset is named "Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County â€“ 2016-2018."

Features
The key feature of this web app is the dynamic choropleth map designed to visually represent heart disease mortality rates. The map allows users to easily comprehend variations in mortality rates across different states, providing valuable insights into the geographic distribution of heart disease in the United States.

How to Use
To explore the data, simply interact with the choropleth map on the web app. Users can hover over states to view detailed information or click for additional insights. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, making it accessible for individuals interested in understanding heart disease mortality trends.
